# BitBox01 end-of-sale/life FAQs

As of 12 November 2019, the BitBox01 is no longer available for purchase. If you are a BitBox01 owner, Please take the time to look through the FAQs below.

### Why is BitBox01 no longer being sold?

The BitBox01 was released in 2016 and was being developed since 2014. Four years later, the industry has matured and we believe users should use the most up to date products when it comes to security. The BitBox01 will be superseded by the BitBox02. 

For more information, please read our [blog post](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/announcing-the-bitbox01-aka-digital-bitbox-end-of-sale-and-end-of-life-dates-and-process-1da088f74e32).


### Can I still keep using my BitBox01?

We will continue to support the BitBox01 with security updates and bug fixes until November 2020. After this date, the BitBox01 will continue to work but may have limited functionality.

After November 2020, we cannot guarantee we will continue releasing updates. But there is nothing preventing us from doing so as circumstances allow.


### What will happen to my BitBox01 now?

The BitBox01 will still be usable. However after November 2020, it may have limited functionality. For example, it may no longer be supported natively in the app. To avoid unnecessary hassle after the end of support date, we recommend moving over to a BitBox02 before November 2020

If you would like to export your private key from BitBox01 microSD card backup directly, please use our [backup center tool](https://guides.shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox01/other/backup-center/).


### Will my coins still be safe?

Your coins will still remain stored by the BitBox01. The BitBox01 will continue to work but may have limited functionality after November 2020. You will always be able to recover and transfer your funds regardless of the end of support date. However, after November 2020, it may be less convenient to move funds off the BitBox01 due to limited functionality. Therefore we recommend moving your funds to a BitBox02 or another wallet before then.

### What does EOL (end-of-life) mean?

EOL (end-of-life) for the BitBox01 means that we will stop actively releasing updates for the BitBox01 after November 2020, but may continue to do so as circumstances allow. EOL also means the lifetime warranty will be terminated. This will take effect in November 2020 for your BitBox01.


### I’m a BitBox01 owner, do I get a discount on a BitBox02?

Yes! We’re offering all BitBox01 customers a 30% loyalty discount to move over to the BitBox02. The discount code will be available with an in-app notification via the next BitBoxApp update.


### I’m still confused, can I talk to someone?

If you have any questions, please contact our support team at support@shiftcrypto.ch.
We will still offer customer support to BitBox01 users after November 2020.
