In order to reset from a backup, your BitBox02 needs to be reset.

## Plug in the microSD card with your backup and plug in the BitBox02
In order to be able to restore from a backup file, the microSD card with the backup on it needs to be plugged in. Once done, plug in your BitBox02 with the BitBox App open.

As your device is reset, you will need to re-pair it again.

Please compare the code on your BitBox02 and in the BitBoxApp and confirm on your BitBox02 if they match. Then click "Confirm & Continue" in the BitBox App.
