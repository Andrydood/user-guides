## Choose the fee
The higher the fee, the quicker your transaction will be confirmed in the blockchain. A low fee should be sufficient for most cases.

## Verify the details in the app and on your BitBox02
It is crucial that you make sure the transaction details are correct. There is no reverse button in Bitcoin.

Please double check all transaction details on your BitBox02.

If what you see on your BitBox02 is correct, then confirm the transaction on your BitBox02.

If you confirmed the transaction on your BitBox02 you should see this screen shortly after:
![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/BitBox02_send/send8.png  "BitBox02 box")

In this case the address I sent to was an address I got by clicking the receive button, i.e. I sent the coins from my BitBox02 to my BitBox02, therefore the transaction is labeled as "Self" in the transaction history view.
