> A Bitcoin address should only be used once. You can think of it like a payment request that expires after it has been used once. You can theoretically re-use a Bitcoin address but we strongly advise against doing so as it is very bad for your privacy. Your BitBox will automatically only show you unused Bitcoin addresses and hide the ones you've already used. So just always go on the receive page when you need a new Bitcoin address.
