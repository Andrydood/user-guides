## Transaction types
There are four different types of transactions that can show up in your transaction history.

### Pending incoming transaction
An incoming transaction will at first be pending. That means it is not confirmed in the Bitcoin blockchain yet. You can see that the transaction in the screenshot is pending in two spots.

1. It says "Pending transaction" on the right of the green "In" symbol
2. Below the wallet balance, which is still zero as only confirmed transactions are counted, it says "Incoming +0.002 BTC"

### Confirmed incoming transaction
Once a formerly pending transaction has its first confirmation (i.e. it was included in a block) it is shown as a confirmed transaction and the transaction amount is added to your wallet balance.

### Pending outgoing transaction
An outgoing transaction will at first be pending. That means it is not confirmed in the Bitcoin blockchain yet. You can see that the transaction in the screenshot is pending as it says "Pending transaction" on the right of the red "Out" symbol

### Confirmed outgoing transaction
Once a formerly pending transaction has its first confirmation (i.e. it was included in a block) it is shown as a confirmed transaction and the transaction amount is deducted from your wallet balance.
