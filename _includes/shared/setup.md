## Insert microSD card & plug in your {{include.product}}
Before you plug in your {{include.product}}, please already **insert the microSD card** which will be needed in a later step.

When done, please plug the {{include.product}} into your computer. Depending on the available ports you might need to use the USB-C to USB-A adapter that came with your {{include.product}}.

---

## Follow the in-App setup-wizard

Once the {{include.product}} is plugged in, the setup-wizard should start which will guide you through the process of setting up your {{include.product}}, creating and backing up your wallet.

### Step 1: Choose display orientation
Most laptops have ports on both sides and as we cannot know from which side you will plug your {{include.product}} you will first need to select your display orientation.

To do that just touch the {{include.product}} on the side that is closer to you.

### Step 2: Confirm pairing code
All information that is exchanged between your computer and the {{include.product}} is encrypted. In order to make sure that there is no man-in-the-middle attack we need to ask you to confirm that the code on your screen and the code on your {{include.product}} are identical.

Please take the time to check all characters.

If both codes match, please confirm on your {{include.product}}, then click "Confirm & Continue" in the BitBox App.
### Step 3: Choose if you want to create a new wallet or restore an existing wallet

Now you are asked to choose if you want to create a new wallet or restores an exisiting wallet.

If this is the first time you create a wallet choose "Create Wallet".

If you already used a {{include.product}} before and you want to restore your wallet from your backup file choose "Restore Backup". (Link to restore wallet)

If you used a different hardware wallet before and you want to restore from the mnemonic seed phrase created by that other wallet, choose "Restore from BIP-39 mnemonic". (link to import bip39)

### Step 4: Create a wallet
First you need to give your wallet a name. This name can be anything, choose a name that you will recognise in the future when you might need to restore from your backup.

If you cannot click the "Name Device & Continue" button make sure that you have your microSD card plugged into the {{include.product}} correctly.

Please then confirm the wallet name on your {{include.product}}.

### Step 5: Set your {{include.product}} device password
Next you need to set a device password for your {{include.product}} which you will need to input every time you want to use your {{include.product}}. Please make sure that you remember this password and that it is not easy to guess.

The setup wizard will show you a video of how to use the touch buttons on your BitBox02 to set and input your password.

### Step 6: Create your wallet backup
After the device password is set, the {{include.product}} will create a backup of your wallet and safe it on the microSD card. To start that process click "Create Backup".

Your {{include.product}} will then ask you to confirm today's date as that is needed for the backup file.

> The backup file on your microSD card is not password protected, unless you use the advanced passphrase feature (link). That means should someone find your microSD card they can steal your funds. Therefore you should **make sure that you store it in a secure location.**

If you want, you can create multiple backups on multiple microSD cards. To do so follow this guide(link).

You can at any point check that you still have a valid wallet. To do so follow this guide (link).



### Step 7: Start stacking sats

Great! Your {{include.product}} is ready to use. Please make sure that you store your backup on your microSD card in a **secure location.**
