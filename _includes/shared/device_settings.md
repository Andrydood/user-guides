## Secrets section
At the top of the device settings you can find the "secrets" section. This section is all about making sure your funds are secure.

It let's you:
* [manage and verify your backups.]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/bitbox02/Basic-features/managing_backups/ ).
* [view your BIP39 seed to back it up on paper or metal.]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/bitbox02/Advanced-features/view_bip39//)
* [reset your {{include.product}}.]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/bitbox02//Advanced-features/reset/)

## Firmware section
The firmware section shows you which firmware version you are running on your {{include.product}} and if you're up to date. Rest assured, we will notify you in the app, on twitter, via our blog and our email newsletter when a new update becomes available.

## Hardware section
This section let's you change your wallet name and use the built in true-random-number-generator (TRNG) to generate a 256-bit random number for the nerds among you.
