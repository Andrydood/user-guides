## Plug in your BitBox device
Before you plug in your BitBox, please already insert the microSD card which will be needed in a later step. When done, please plug the BitBox into your computer. Depending on the available ports you might need to use the USB-C to USB-A adapter that came with your BitBox.

## Follow the setup-wizard

Once the BitBox is plugged in, the setup-wizard should start which will guide you through the process of setting up your BitBox, creating and backing up your wallet.

### Step 1: Choose display orientation
Most laptops have ports on both sides and as we cannot know from which side you will plug your BitBox02 you will first need to select your display orientation.

To do that just touch the BitBox02 on the side that is closer to you.

### Step 2: Confirm pairing code
All information that is exchanged between your computer and the BitBox02 is encrypted. In order to make sure that there is no man-in-the-middle attack we need to ask you to confirm that the code on your screen and the code on your BitBox02 are identical.

Please take the time to check all characters.

If both codes match, please confirm on your BitBox02, then click "Confirm & Continue" in the BitBox App.
### Step 3: Choose if you want to create a new wallet or restore an existing wallet

Now you are asked to choose if you want to create a new wallet or restores an exisiting wallet.

If this is the first time you create a wallet choose "Create Wallet".

If you already used a BitBox02 before and you want to restore your wallet from your backup file choose "Restore Backup".

If you used a different hardware wallet before and you want to restore from the mnemonic seed phrase created by that other wallet, choose "Restore from BIP-39 mnemonic"
